lowlive
=======

basic radio automation in the browser

lowlive is a bundle of Perl scripts, which allow you to remote control audio playout on a server. The lowlive project and code base has been travelling with me from laptop to laptop since 2000. I kept it for two reasons. 

Firstly, because it was the first "proof of concept" for what later became Airtime
* https://github.com/sourcefabric/Airtime
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime 

Secondly, because I just love the skin 'city' I hacked together in 2000. See below :)

Despite the fact that the playout transisitons between tracks were quite crude (piping into the audio out, basically), it did have a number of features which still hold up today:

* upload files and create playlists
* schedule remote live streams
* schedule remote files
* multi-user access
