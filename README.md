lowlive
=======

basic radio automation in the browser

lowlive is a bundle of Perl scripts, which allow you to remote control audio playout on a server. The lowlive project and code base has been travelling with me from laptop to laptop since 2000. I kept it for two reasons. 

Firstly, because it was the first "proof of concept" for what later became Airtime
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime 

Secondly, because I just love the skin 'city' I made back in 2010 :)

lowlive was written in Perl, and despite the fact that the transisitons between tracks were quite crude (piping into the audio out, basically), it did have a number of features which are still nice to have today:

* upload files and create playlists
* schedule remote live streams
* schedule remote files
* multi-user access
